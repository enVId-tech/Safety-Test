Before we start, I might say that it is NECESSARY that you do not delete the Safety-Test folder in public/Tests
You may delete or create any other folder, but the safety test folder is the base folder and must not be removed, unless there is a replacement going in immediately.



--Test Creation Guide--


First, navigate to folder location "public/Tests/"


Secondly, create a new folder. Your folder name should be "####-Test". 
If you require more words, you can change the index.js file in index.js.


After that, there should be three items in your folder.
 - settings.yml
 - ######Test.txt (Check IMPORTANT for more details)
 - index.html


IMPORTANT: Your .txt file MUST be the same as the name chosen in settings:
(Ex: if "Questionfilename: MechanicalTest.txt", your test name should be MechanicalTest.txt. You can change this to whatever you want.)




The contents of the index.html file is as follows:


<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><meta charset="UTF-8" /><title>OA Robotics Testing Redirect</title><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"><link rel="shortcut icon" href="/items/4079-transparent.png" type="image/x-icon"><script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script><script type="text/javascript" src="/js-css/LocStorTest.js"></script><link rel="stylesheet" href="/js-css/LocStorTest.css"></head><body><center id="Center"><h1 id="RedirectText">Redirecting to chosen test...</h1></center></body></html>


Copy and paste this line into your index.html file.




In your settings.yml folder, the file structure should start off with these contents (You may add more, but it must be reflected in public/js-css/test.js):

# Settings folder, controlling functions of the test
# DO NOT RENAME FOLDER OR REMOVE THESE FIRST TWO LINES
Questions: 1
AnswersPerQuestion: 4
TeamGUI: true/false
CategoryGUI: true/false
Questionfilename: ToolsTest.txt
Accessable: true/false
SafetyTestGuides: true/false
RequiresUsername: true/false
TypeofTest: Tooling
SetCategory: true/false


Your AnswersPerQuestion settings should be less than the collective minimum amount of answers all questions have
It is recommended if you have SetCategory to true, CategoryGUI should be false, however you don't have to follow this if you want a default





In your ####Test.txt file, you should have a similar file structure to this:

Question 1: What color is the sky?
 + Blue
 - Red
 - Yellow
 - Purple
 + Not Purple

Question 2: Where is New York City located?
 + New York State
 + United States of America
 - United Kingdom
 - California
 - The Pacific Ocean
 + Near the Atlantic Ocean

...

NOTE: If a text file has a starting character of #, it is a HIDDEN file and will not be shown to test users.
You will still be able to access it if you type in the file path, providing an alternative to the "Accessable" setting.

And thats all you have to do to set this up. There will eventually be a script that can automatically do this for you,
but you can use the base structure at the moment. Thank you for your time.

First, navigate to folder location "public/Tests"


Secondly, create a new folder. Your folder name should be "#############-Test". 
If you require more words, you can change the index.js file in src/index.js.


After that, there should be two items in your folder. One is a folder called: "ItemsFolder"
The other file is called "index.html".



The contents of this index.html file is as follows:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>OA Robotics Testing Redirect</title>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="shortcut icon" href="/items/4079-transparent.png" type="image/x-icon">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/js-css/LocStorTest.js"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/js-css/LocStorTest.css">
</head>

<body>
    <center id="Center">
        <h1 id="RedirectText">Redirecting to chosen test...</h1>
    </center>
</body>

</html>




Afterwards, save and move onto the ItemsFolder folder

In the ItemsFolder folder, there should be 2 items:
 - settings.yml (Cap sensitive)
 - ####Test.txt (Look for IMPORTANT below for more information)

IMPORTANT: Your .txt file MUST be the same name as the main test folder
(Ex: If your test name is Tools-Test, your .txt file should be ToolsTest.txt)



In your settings.yml folder, the file structure should start off with these contents (You may add more, but it must be reflected in test.html/app.js):

# Settings folder, controlling functions of the test
# DO NOT RENAME FOLDER OR REMOVE THESE FIRST TWO LINES
Questions: 1
AnswersPerQuestion: 4
TeamGUI: true/false
CategoryGUI: true/false
Questionfilename: ToolsTest.txt
Accessable: true/false
SafetyTestGuides: true/false
RequiresUsername: true/false
TypeofTest: Tooling
SetCategory: true/false


Your AnswersPerQuestion settings should be less than the collective minimum amount of answers all questions have
It is recommended if you have SetCategory to true, CategoryGUI should be false, however you don't have to follow this if you want a default



In your ####Test.txt file, you should have a similar file structure to this:

Question 1: What color is the sky?
 + Blue
 - Red
 - Yellow
 + Purple

Question 2: Where is New York City located?
 + New York State
 + United States of America
 - United Kingdom
 - California
 - The Pacific Ocean
 + Near the Atlantic Ocean

...




And thats all you have to do to set this up. There will eventually be a script that can automatically do this for you,
but you can use the base structure at the moment. Thank you for your time.

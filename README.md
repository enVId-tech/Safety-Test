# OA-Robotics-Safety-Test
This is a repository for an updated version of the OA Robotics Safety Test available for public use.


Hi all, Lil Gamer Playz (Erick) here. If you are seeing this, this is a repository for the OA Robotics Safety Test I made.

This is a really complex project I had to work on and spend a lot of man-hours working on, so please don't distribute this unless it is to remake the test


Realistically, I don't have more to say other than that, but a Q&A will be available below.




      Q: What are the functions of this safety test?
      
A: The answer of that is complication, but it is split between three groups of files:
The actual safety test (as well as an older version of the safety test)
The administrator panel, for editting as well as changing the questions on the test, as well as the test itself
In the middle are the libraries which communicate with both the admin panel and the safety test.

The safety test acts like the safety test you can find here: https://tests.frc4079.org/SafetyTest/test.php

The adminstrator panel (at the moment, is not secure, however I am planning on adding functionality on that soon,) is a place where you can edit, rework,
or even create new safety tests. They have the power to see the scores of everyone (I'm planning on adding that eventually), as well as being able to
make different types of safety tests compared to the standard ones found at the link above. Basically, the adminstration for that can do basically anything.



        Q: How many hours did it actually take you to do this?
        
A: It started as a fun project. I was bored one day so I couldn't help myself not to do something productive, as well as to advance my HTML skills.
It was only when I showed it to the rest of cabinet and the leads that I thought that this might have been a real thing that we could have done.
I believe, so far on the day that I am making this (9/3/22), this took a cumulative 6 days of time, spread over about 2 weeks. It was mainly because I was bored,
but it did become a real thing that did happen.



Anyway, that's it for me. I need to go code now. If you are reading this. I hope you have a great day (evening? morning? whatever). :))

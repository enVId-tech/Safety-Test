# OA-Robotics-Safety-Test
This is a repository for an updated version of the OA Robotics Safety Test available.

--Minor Update 20.01--

Hosted on and available at http://frc4079.org/safetytest or http://safetytest.csproject.org

Required: NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)



Q&A avilable here:

      Q: What are the functions of this safety test?
      
A: There is quite an exhaustive list of functions that this safety test can do, as outlined in both the test creation folder as well as what you can see inside of the directory itself, but the primary objective was to create a test that functioned the same as the original test located at this link: https://tests.frc4079.org/SafetyTest/test.php. It's general purpose is to provide a location to provide a test while being able to randomize it and give feedback on what is wrong and what is right, based on a scoring system.

    Q: How does this work?

A: Generally, there are three pages to this test, the first is the homepage, the second is an optional selection page, and the third is the actual test page. You can create a test based on the guide available in the main directory, and selection is available on the main screen. The user will have to enter their name and the test that they want to take (default is the safety test) and move on to the next page. If chosen, they will go to selection where they will be asked to make a selection on their team name, or else they will go directly to the test. Then on the final page, the user will finally take the test.

    Q: Can I make my own custom tests?

A: Yes! A full length document available at the main path of this repository can be used as an example on how to create a test, and subsequently adjust any parameters of the test as necessary.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
